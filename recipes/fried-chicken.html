    <h2>Best Fried Chicken Wings</h2>
    <p>
      Fried chicken wings prepared Buffalo-style that taste absolutely
      wonderful!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chicken: This recipe makes 12 chicken wings, but itâ€™s easy to double or
        even triple it for a larger crowd.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: What makes these fried chicken wings so flavorful? A
        combination of seasoned salt, coarse salt, black pepper, paprika, and
        cayenne pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flour: Coat the wings in a seasoned all-purpose flour mixture before
        frying for extra crispy skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil: Use a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil,
        to fry the chicken wings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauce: Use store-bought Buffalo wing sauce or make your own at home.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
      <li>
        Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a
        wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange
        in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to
        30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate
        wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of
        the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss
        to coat.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
